Note:
* talk about the process Intersect is going through to professionalise our training delivery, and why?
* As university libraries are changing in their role along with the changing needs of their clientele, I imagine there is some motivation in this library to effectively engage
* well Intersect is going through a similar process at the moment, about how to provide service delivery, specifically to do with our training, most effectively!
* for intersect, our main offering to universities has been our training program. we are the biggest training provider specifically for researchers, in Aust, a position which we have fallen into, rather than by grand strategy

---
## First, some questions...
* What group sessions does the Library run? By whom? |
* How are sessions delivered? |
* What type of supporting material is there? |
* How are these materials managed and kept current? |
* How are materials distributed? |
